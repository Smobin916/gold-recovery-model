# gold-recovery-model

Project Introduction
This project aims to build a predictive model for gold recovery from raw material inputs. The data is provided in three files: gold_recovery_train.csv, gold_recovery_test.csv, and gold_recovery_full.csv. The goal is to ensure the correctness of the data, analyze the features, and build a model that accurately predicts gold recovery.
