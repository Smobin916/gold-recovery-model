# Gold Recovery Predictive Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a robust predictive model to estimate gold recovery from raw material inputs. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to ensure data integrity, analyze key features, and deliver accurate predictions for gold recovery rates. The data is provided in three files: **gold_recovery_train.csv**, **gold_recovery_test.csv**, and **gold_recovery_full.csv**.

## Features
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring the correctness and consistency of the provided data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizing trends and identifying feature correlations.
  - Detecting missing values and outliers for preprocessing.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Selection and tuning of machine learning algorithms for optimal performance.
  - Evaluation metrics like RMSE, R², and Mean Absolute Error to assess model effectiveness.

## Tools and Techniques
1. **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.
2. **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Used for visualizing data distributions, relationships, and trends.
3. **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
   - Models like XGBoost or LightGBM for predictive analytics.
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - RMSE and R² for model validation and performance assessment.
